Welcome to the **Binary Tree (BST) Visualizer**! This is a Python-based application that allows you to **dynamically visualize** a Binary Tree using the `tkinter` library. With this tool, you can **insert values** into the tree, **view the structure** in real-time, and even **save the tree as an image** for your reference.

  

## Features:

-  **Insert Values**: Easily add values into the tree and watch it grow dynamically.

-  **Real-time Visualization**: See the tree structure update immediately as values are added.

-  **Clear Tree**: Reset the tree at any time.

-  **Save Tree as Image**: Capture and save the current state of the tree as an image.

  

## Requirements :

- Python 3.x

-  `tkinter` (typically pre-installed with Python)

  

## Installation :

  

1. Clone or download this repository.

2. Run the Python script to launch the application.

  

## Usage:

1.  **Insert Values** : Enter integer values in the input field and click "Insert Value."

2.  **View Tree** : As you insert values, the tree structure will update and be displayed on the canvas.

3.  **Clear Tree** : Click "Clear Tree" to remove all values from the tree.

4.  **Save Tree** : Click "Save Tree as Image" to capture the current tree structure and save it as a PNG image.

  

## Example Workflow :

1. Open the application.

2. Type a number (e.g., `10`) into the input field and click "Insert Value."

3. The tree will display with the newly added value.

4. Insert more numbers and observe the tree's real-time update.

5. Save the tree image by clicking "Save Tree as Image."
